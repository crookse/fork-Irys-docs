# Controlling the upload

Uploads created with the chunked uploader can be paused and resumed at any time using the functions `uploader.pause()` and `uploader.resume()`. For these functions to work, the initial call to `uploader.uploadData()` or `uploader.uploadTransaction()` must not be preceded with the `await` keyword.

To resume an upload from a new uploader instance, you must use the same:

-   Token
-   Node
-   Input data
-   Configured chunk size

## `uploader.pause()` and `uploader.resume()`

```js
const irys = await getIrys();

// When uploading smaller files, it's common to use the await keyword before
// uploadData() or uploadTransaction(). This causes execution to pause until the file
// is fully uploaded. If you omit await, the upload happens in the background
// and you can use pause and resume as needed.
transaction = irys.createTransaction("Hello, world!");
uploader = irys.uploader.chunkedUploader; // recreate for each transaction
const upload = uploader.uploadTransaction(transaction);
uploader.pause(); // pauses the upload
console.log("Upload paused");
uploader.resume(); // resumes the upload
console.log("Upload resumed");
```

While the initial call to `uploader.uploadData()` or `uploader.uploadTransaction()` should not use the `await` keyword, you can use it down the line to ensure the upload has completed.

You can call await at ANY TIME to ensure the upload has completed.

```js
response = await upload;
```
